# Dataloop_Roni

The game is consisted of 3 python files, each running on a different terminal.
First, run "server.py" for initializing the sever instances.
Second, run "pong-cli.py" with the desired command for manipulating the game.
Third, to watch the game run "watch_game.py" file.

Right now there is only one instance that sending "Pong" messages.
WIP - To add "ping" instance.
